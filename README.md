Case Study 10 MSDS7333

Assignment: Using Statistics to Identify Spam
Module 10.8 outlines a possible case study for the unit. It is to compare the performance of Na√Øve Bayes, CART, and one other classification algorithm of your choosing in classifying messages as spam or ham.

You have the option to choose one (and only one) of the following problems from the back of chapter 19, 20, or 21 instead of the case study mentioned at the end of module 10.8.

Whichever case study you choose, write a report on your analysis, including introduction, background, methods, results, and conclusions/discussions. We will spend time in the live session or in asynchronous materials on cleaning the data; therefore, your write-up need only focus on answering the question of your choice. In other words, you do not have to include code that is already in the chapter or in other class materials.
